## üò§ The Problem We All Face

Picture this: You're trying to swap some tokens on Base, but you're 0.001 ETH short on gas. Your ETH is sitting on Ethereum, but you need it on Base. So you:

1. Go to a bridge (which one? ü§î)
2. Wait 10-15 minutes for the bridge transaction
3. Pay extra fees for the bridge
4. Finally get your ETH on Base
5. Realize you need more gas anyway... üòÖ

**Sound familiar?** We built Gas Refuel because we were tired of this dance. Now you can refuel any chain from any other chain in seconds, not minutes.

## ‚ú® What Makes This Special

- üöÄ **One-Click Magic**: Seriously, just click and it works. No more hunting for the right bridge
- üìä **See Everything**: Your gas balance across all chains in one beautiful dashboard
- ‚ö° **Quick Refuel**: Pre-set amounts for common needs ($5, $10, $20 worth of gas)
- üîí **Battle-Tested**: Built on Avail's rock-solid infrastructure (they've been doing this for years)
- üí∞ **Actually Cheaper**: Better rates through shared liquidity pools
- üì± **Works Everywhere**: Desktop, mobile, tablet - looks great on all of them

## üåâ All Your Favorite Chains (And More!)

We support **8 major testnets** so you can refuel wherever you're building:

| Chain            | Network    | Symbol | Status    | Why We Love It   |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ------ | --------- | ---------------- |
| Ethereum Sepolia | `11155111` | ETH    | ‚úÖ Active | The OG testnet   |
| Base Sepolia     | `84532`    | ETH    | ‚úÖ Active | Coinbase's baby  |
| Arbitrum Sepolia | `421614`   | ETH    | ‚úÖ Active | Lightning fast   |
| Optimism Sepolia | `11155420` | ETH    | ‚úÖ Active | Super optimistic |
| Polygon Amoy     | `80002`    | MATIC  | ‚úÖ Active | Polygon's latest |
| Scroll Sepolia   | `534351`   | ETH    | ‚úÖ Active | ZK-powered       |
| Linea Sepolia    | `59141`    | ETH    | ‚úÖ Active | ConsenSys magic  |
| Mantle Sepolia   | `5003`     | MNT    | ‚úÖ Active | Modular future   |

_More chains coming soon! We're always adding new ones._

## üõ†Ô∏è The Tech Behind the Magic

We're powered by **Avail Nexus SDK** - and honestly, it's pretty amazing. Here's what we're using:

### What We Built With

- **`@avail-project/nexus-core`**: The brain that makes cross-chain magic happen
- **`@avail-project/nexus-widgets`**: Pre-built components (because we're lazy in the best way)
- **Cross-chain Transfers**: One function call, infinite possibilities
- **Real-time Balances**: See your money everywhere, instantly
- **Intent-based UX**: You say what you want, we figure out how to do it

### The Code That Makes It Work

```typescript
// This is literally all it takes to bridge ETH across chains
const nexusService = new NexusService("testnet");
await nexusService.initialize(walletClient);

const result = await nexusService.bridge({
  token: "ETH",
  amount: "0.05",
  fromChainId: 11155111, // Ethereum Sepolia
  toChainId: 84532, // Base Sepolia
});

// That's it. No complex bridge contracts, no waiting for confirmations.
// Just works. ‚ú®
```

### Why We Chose Avail Nexus

1. **It Actually Works**: No more debugging bridge contracts at 3 AM
2. **Better Rates**: Shared liquidity = better prices for everyone
3. **Intent-Based**: Users don't need to understand the technical details
4. **Developer Joy**: Clean API that doesn't make you want to throw your laptop
5. **Production Ready**: These guys know what they're doing

_Pro tip: Get ETH on 2-3 different chains, then use Gas Refuel to move it around!_

### How to Use It (It's Really Simple)

1. **Connect Your Wallet**: Click the big blue button
2. **See Your Money**: Watch your balances appear across all chains
3. **Refuel Something**: Pick a chain that needs gas, pick where to get it from, enter amount
4. **Wait 30 seconds**: Grab some coffee ‚òï
5. **Success!**: Your gas is now where you need it

_That's literally it. No complex UI, no confusing steps._

## üì± See It In Action

[Watch our 2-minute demo](https://youtube.com/watch?v=demo) to see how ridiculously easy this is.

**What you'll see:**

- Wallet connection (takes 10 seconds)
- Balances updating in real-time (it's pretty satisfying)
- A refuel happening (spoiler: it just works)
- Transaction links to block explorers (for the nerds)

## üß™ We Tested Everything (So You Don't Have To)

### What We've Tested

- **Wallet Stuff**: Connecting, disconnecting, switching accounts
- **Balance Magic**: Real-time updates across all 8 chains
- **Cross-chain Transfers**: Every possible combination (that's 56 combinations!)
- **Error Handling**: What happens when you don't have enough gas
- **Mobile/Desktop**: Looks great everywhere

### Our Testing Process

1. **Connect wallet** with testnet ETH on multiple chains
2. **Try refueling** from Ethereum ‚Üí Base (the classic)
3. **Watch balances** update in real-time (it's mesmerizing)
4. **Check block explorers** to make sure it actually happened
5. **Test edge cases** like insufficient funds, rejected transactions
6. **Break things** and fix them (that's how we learn)

_We broke it so you don't have to!_ üòÖ

## üèÜ Built for ETHGlobal Online 2025

### Why We're Here

We built this for the **Avail Track** because honestly, their SDK is pretty incredible. We're competing for:
